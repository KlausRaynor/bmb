Description
==

> This project was built around my girlfriend's fruit carving and arrangement business, Bite Me Bouquet.  There are a handful of kinks to iron out, and the look and feel has to be modernized, but it was a very intense and interesting experience to develop this laravel app.  
   To start, sign up for the service and then browse the available bouquets.  Add any to cart, and then view cart to see how it is updated.  You can then edit (add or delete) the contents of your cart as you wish.  User name and password is authenticated and validated.  Cart controller is the only thing that remains a little unbalanced.  Thank you!
